# BRLO

why it is so hard <br />
to just be who i am

i am free <br />
always making the best of myself <br />
only love in my heart <br />
only everything in my brain <br />
i have nothing to be ashamed of

why are you telling me what not to do <br />
that i need to behave <br />
that i need to put on an act

why must i feel <br />
like I must surveil myself <br />
and present myself <br />
as something i am not

here you are <br />
standing in my way with <br />
all your preconceptions <br />
instead of love and support <br />
of my decision <br />
to be my best self <br />
for myself and hence for us too

you draw lines around you <br />
ingroup and outgroup <br />
and so <br />
there's a line inside you too <br />
between <br />
what you present to be <br />
and what you are <br />
the 本音 and 建前

when really <br />
my being <br />
just <br />
is.

i am the good and the bad <br />
the beauty and the ugly <br />
the sober and the high <br />
the monk and the warrior <br />
the artist and the mathematician <br />
the anarchist in the market

because life just is <br />
and things just are <br />
and i am just me <br />
and i am just free

i want to be <br />
in a safe space <br />
around my family

but i dont feel safe <br />
when i'm around you
