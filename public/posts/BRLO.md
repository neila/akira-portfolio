why it is so hard \
to just be who i am

i am free \
always making the best of myself \
only love in my heart \
only everything in my brain \
i have nothing to be ashamed of

why are you telling me what not to do \
that i need to behave \
that i need to put on an act

why must i feel \
like must surveil myself \
and present myself \
as something i am not

here you are \
standing in my way with \
all your preconceptions \
instead of love and support \
of my decision \
to be my best self \
for myself and hence for us too

you draw lines around you \
ingroup and outgroup \
and so \
there's a line inside you too \
between \
what you present to be \
and what you are \
the 本音 and 建前

when really \
my being \
just \
is.

i am the good and the bad \
the beauty and ugly \
the sober and the high \
the monk and the warrior \
the artist and the mathematician \
the anarchist in the market

because life just is \
and i am just me \
and i am just free

i want to be \
in a safe space \
around my family

but i dont feel safe \
when i'm around you
