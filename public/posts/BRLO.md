# BRLO

the most profound thoughts <br />
cannot be expressed in words

but I swear I found it <br />
not long ago <br />
somewhere <br />
in a mycelial state of mind

i am the good and the bad <br />
the beauty and the ugly <br />
the sober and the high <br />
the monk and the warrior <br />
the artist and the mathematician <br />
the anarchist in the market

life just is <br />
and things just are <br />
and i am just me <br />
and i am just free
