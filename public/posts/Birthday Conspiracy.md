# Birthday Conspiracy

It's my flatmate Danielle's birthday. Dinner at Cho Dang Gol, a Korean BBQ place recommended by the birthday girl herself. Actually, she told us it was recommended in the Michelin guide. How very Danielle.

The interior is well designed, giving an actual Korean cozy pocha vibe. Dimly lit with fairy lights and lanterns; the walls painted brownish red like clay, framed in wood. They actually say the color red enhances appetite, so no wonder all the menu looked fucking delicious. The menu photos were all edited and saturated in that palette too. Or it might have been the weed I smoked on the way walking here. Anyways, I ordered a dolsot bibimbap; spicy pork on hot stone. My favorite go-to since Seoul.

Danielle and her cousin Taylor is chit chatting, catching up with life. We're sitting by the window side, and there's a random dude dancing outside on the street (a New York staple), Taylor calls him a "crazy guy". It's not particularly a wide street, so the pedestrians and the cars are all kinda just intermingling and getting through each other, all of them seemingly busy to get somewhere. Except for the crazy guy.

There's something very surreal about celebrating a 1/7,000,000,000 person's 23rd revolution around the Sun; sitting in a cozy pocha, where behind the coziness is a busy and elaborate scheme to maximize appetite and profit, both by the establishment and a tire company; 5 steps outside the window are nonstop flow of people and cars, all busily heading somewhere in this city of profit; elevator jazz is playing in the back, and the crazy guy dances to it.
