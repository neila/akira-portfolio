# Security, Privacy, and Anonymity
## Privacy

Privacy is the quality, or state, of being free from:
	1. unauthorized observation
	2. unauthorized intrusion

An example of privacy is like a living in a high-rise mansion; others might know you live there, but they wouldn't know what goes on in your apartment (unless they were explicitly invited over to join your secret party, of course).

## Anonymity

For an activity to be anonymous, it means that its origin or authorship:
	1. is not named or identified
	2. lacks individuality, distinction, or recognizability

An example of anonymity is like sending a secret Valentine's Card to someone; the recipient will know about your feelings towards them expressed in the letter, but they don't know who you are.

## When to care for privacy and anonymity

Generally, you want to maximize your online privacy at all scenarios. You don't even need a reason to justify it. There's only so many people in the world who should be concerned about your online activity; yourself, those who you are communicating with (I mean, you do want your messages to be read by your intended recipient, right?), and probably nobody else.

Online anonymity is often less necessary in usual situations and is more of a consideration per case-by-case basis. Anonymity can provide some protection when engaging with sensitive material and/or topics, such as asking for advice in online forums, expressing controversial views, exposing someone or some entity, conducting illegal activities, etc.

Note that privacy and anonymity are not qualities which you either have, or have not; there are varying degrees of both. Assume that there is no such thing as full privacy or true anonymity.

## The tension between privacy and anonymity

Good security measures are generally a prerequisite to protecting privacy. However, these measures can, and do often, also conflict with protecting anonymity. For example, a secure login system may detect suspicious access attempts from a different country. While this measure may help better protect user privacy, it certainly compromises their anonymity.

For most people (and probably for most of your uses too), privacy is far more important than anonymity. It is important that you don't misinterpret this tension, for a misguided pursuit towards anonymity can actually compromise your privacy as well as anonymity itself. It's pretty easy to imagine, for example, that a shoplifter wearing a ski mask in broad daylight at the mall isn't less exposed; in fact, they probably end up attracting more unwanted attention.

## Tl;dr

- Privacy is when they may know who you are, but they don't know what you're doing. Anonymity is when they may know what you're doing, but they don't know who you are.

- Online privacy is good and should be maximized; in fact, the burden of proof is on the need to justify less privacy; whether it is due to some necessity or otherwise inevitability. The need for online anonymity is more circumstantial.

- Privacy and anonymity are not discrete states; both exist in varying degrees and can only be defined contextually. (privacy/anonymity from whom? what is the threat model?)

- Understanding the distinction between the two allows you to build better security precautions against your specific threat model. On the contrary, failure to do so can (read: will) severely compromise security.
