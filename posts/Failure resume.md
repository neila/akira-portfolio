# Failure Resume

Failure resume, as the name suggests, is a list of things that didnâ€™t go to plan. A list of things that made me stronger.

I learn through failure as much as I do from success. This resume is a way to document these learnings. It also reminds me that I tried, and to keep trying.

Thanks to my friend <a href='https://twitter.com/_jzhao'>Jacky Zhao</a> for introducing me to this concept.

## 2021 
1. Rejected by the South Park Commons and Delta fellowship
2. Rejected by Spotify
    - This hurt. As an avid lover of both music and tech, I was genuinely interested in working for them in shaping the future of music consumption. I am also a longtime user of the app and worked on personal projects with their developer API several times, so I thought I had a shot. 
    - The rejection helped me rekindle my passion to be a creative myself, rather than to sit in front of a computer deciding which creative would be recommend to which user. 
3. Could not deliver the full intended concept of my college capstone project
    - This was a moment where I faced the classic tradeoff between submitting a passing but mediocre project on time vs not submitting at all. Except, I really cared about this project personally, so it was emotionally difficult to make the decision to submit the project anyways. With my degree now, it is a decision I do not necessarily regret. Perfectionism is a double-edged sword between passion and daydreaming; it must be used wisely.

## 2020
1. Spent the quarantine not being productive
    - Okay, I fundamentally do not believe that being productive is the hallmark of success nor being unproductive is a failure. There is more to life than efficiently getting things done. That being said, I do sometimes want to yell at my past self for having a historic amount of freedom as the world essentially paused, and still not having picked up a new skill or two. There are literally millions of people who started something new during quarantine and have already achieved high feats. Come on, bruh.
	- I did start meditating though, and it has greatly helped me reorient my priorities and values in life, as well as general mental health, so I guess not being busy isn't the end of the world.
2. Smoked too much cigarettes
    - I could feel the cells of my body poisoning and yet I could not stop. What was once a coping mechanism against stress, eventually became a source of it. A box was a mere 150 pesos in Buenos Aires, so that didn't help much either.

## 2019
1. Rejected by the Santa Fe Institute for a research position
2. Lost a friend
    - Things went sideways. I was so out of it at the time that I foolishly decided to cut them off entirely. This was probably one of the worst mistakes of my life. I still have yet to patch this up. Maybe I never will. I hope it can happen though.
